          TRACK INTERVIEWS
          (Conducted by David Coulthard)
        Q: Max Verstappen, pole position. There was a little bit of everything in that Qualifying session but in the end, a very impressive full half a second quicker than the second man.
        Max VERSTAPPEN: Yeah, it was a very tricky Qualifying. Starting, of course, with the Intermediates but also, the track surface is quite slippery, the new tarmac. So yeah, it was all about putting your laps in but also staying out of trouble. I think we managed that quite well but then also at the end, when we could go onto the slick tyres again, there was like one dry line in some places and we had to risk it a bit – but that last lap was very enjoyable.
        Q: The management between yourself and the race team there, getting you out on track, the only time it looked like a questionable decision was you went out on the Intermediate when the track was just starting to dry, and others had gone out on slicks. We heard you on team radio questioning.
        Lando NORRIS: Thank you. No, I’m happy still. P2 was a good result, I guess, in these kind of conditions. Every now and again you hope Max makes a mistake and he doesn’t. Frustrating in a little way but I’m very happy. The team’s done a good job. It was a chaotic qualifying but another P2, so… good.
        Q: You mentioned the conditions. It’s really challenging when you know, as the clock ticks down, you want to be one of the last across the line. How stressful is a changing weather conditions Qualifying like that?

Isack Hadjar came out on top in a halted Sprint Race in Zandvoort for Hitech Pulse-Eight. The Red Bull junior finished ahead of ART Grand Prix’s Victor Martins and Ferrari junior Oliver Bearman, who made a late dive at the rolling start to take third.

The race was red flagged following a three-way collision on the opening lap and was shortly resumed under Safety Car, but torrential rain stopped the proceedings. No points were awarded as two racing laps were not completed without a Safety Car intervention.

F2: Crawford goes early to secure maiden pole in stop-start Zandvoort drama

As rain fell on the Dutch circuit, championship leader Theo Pourchaire wasn’t able to take the start from reverse grid pole after a mechanical issue forced the ART driver to begin from the pit lane.

Hadjar went late on the rolling start to fend off Martins, as Bearman swooped up the inside of Juan Manuel Correa at Turn 1 for third.

Contact on the opening lap between Kush Maini and Jak Crawford sent both cars spinning off at Turn 5, with Ralph Boschung unable to avoid colliding with his Campos Racing teammate. The Safety Car was deployed before being switched out for a Red Flag on Lap 3, as all three drivers clambered out of their cars.

         Max Verstappen could not hide his delight after securing a third straight Dutch Grand Prix victory in a wet and wild encounter at Zandvoort, which also saw him draw level with Sebastian Vettel’s record for the most successive F1 wins.
         
         Verstappen overcame the changeable weather conditions, the appearance of the Virtual Safety Car, full Safety Car and a red flag to net his ninth win on the bounce and 11th win from 13 races this season, further extending his championship lead in the process.

TRACK INTERVIEWS

(Conducted by Giedo van der Garde)

Q: Pierre Gasly, P3. Man, I think that must be satisfying, no? What a result for you and the team, the first podium for you together with Alpine.

Pierre GASLY: All I want to say is, let's go! Yes! I’m feeling so stoked, honestly. What a race, coming back from the summer break and, you know, it hasn't been the easiest start of the year, just trying to improve race by race and it was good to get some time off, come back and straight into it. We had a third place in Spa in the Sprint, it wasn't exactly like a normal podium and I'm super pleased for all the guys to get that P3.

Q: When you heard Pérez had a five seconds penalty, I guess you were pushing flat out in the last few laps?

Continue Below

PG: Yeah, I was pretty upset that I got a five second penalty earlier in the race and I was like ‘OK, now it's 1-1’, and then, yeah, obviously I tried to push as hard as I could to stay within five seconds, and managed to do it. It was a very long race. Very challenging from start to finish and it was greatly executed from all the guys.

Q: Perfect, enjoy it, man. Fernando, P2. Why is it always you love those tricky conditions, on the beginning, at the end, it looks like in the rain, half wet, this is really your thing?

Fernando ALONSO: Yeah, it was a very intense race, obviously at the beginning with wet conditions we were very, very fast. And we stopped maybe one lap too late, but the same as the leaders. And yeah, the car was flying today – very competitive, very easy to drive. In these conditions, you need a car that you can trust and I did try the car a lot today. So, I did enjoy, thanks to all the fans. The energy that we live here in Zandvoort is very unique. It was two years ago when this race came, I thought I will never experience maybe the Zandvoort podium because I was not in a position to think about that. And today it’s going to be very special to share the podium with Max and Pierre now.

Q: That’s nice to hear. Was it hard for you, because there's like a party going on and you have this wait with the red flag and you have to jump back in the car you have to concentrate, but the crowd was going mad. I guess it must be hard to get back in the zone?

FA: Yeah, it is one of those races that is difficult, as you said, to concentrate, to stay focused for such a long period of time but yeah, as I said, I think this is a very special race track, with all the fans and the energy going on, so you feel always very focused. Happy for Max, congratulations to everyone. I did think about trying a move in the last restart but then I thought maybe I cannot exit the circuit so I stayed calm in second.

Q: Enjoy, man. Max Verstappen, for the third time in a row the winner of the Heineken Dutch Grand Prix. This must feel amazing?

Max VERSTAPPEN: Incredible and also today they didn't make it easy for us I think with the weather to make all the time the right calls. But yeah, incredibly proud. I mean, I already had goose bumps when they were playing the national anthem before the start. And you know, even with all the bad weather, the rain, the fans were still going at it, so an incredible atmosphere.

Q: You also now equalled Sebastian Vettel with nine wins in a row. I think that's mega spectacular. Are you up for the 10th one next week?

MV: I'll think about it next week. I'm first going to enjoy this weekend. You know it's always tough. The pressure is on to perform and very happy of course to win here.
